### Flow Bar
The flow bar is a Karate Man gameplay modifier that changes how the game is played. Meter is gained by hitting objects, and meter is lost by missing. High flow is required to hit certain object types (rock, cooking pot, alien, bomb, and taco bell). There are two Flow Bar modes: Tengoku and Mania.
#### Tengoku
The Tengoku flow bar measures five points. The bar increases by one for every successful hit. Inputting too early or too late, as well as hitting a hard object while at low flow, will drop the bar by one point; completely missing will deplete the bar completely. Hitting hard objects requires three points or higher.
#### Mania
The Tengoku flow bar measures ten points. The bar increases by a number based on the total amount of inputs in the Karate Man segment; a more input-dense segment will grant less points per hit, while a less dense segment will grant more per hit. Inputting too early or too late, as well as hitting a hard object while at low flow, will drop the bar by a variable amount; completely missing will deplete the bar completely. Hitting hard objects requires seven points or higher.

### Tips
- The Tinted shadow option for `set background color` makes the shadow a bit redder, too.
- `hit3` doesn't actually spawn the objects, so don't forget to do that!
- A yellow `bulb` is commonly used to indicate kicks, and a blue one is used to indicate combos.
- `hit3`'s HitThreeAlt is from Karate Man Kicks.
- `prepare` is best used for sections where the `hit`s are offbeat, to add some tension.

### Legality
- No two `hit` or `bulb` cues should start at the same time.
- `kick` or `combo` should not overlap with `hit`, `bulb`, or eachother while the combo/kick is in progress.
