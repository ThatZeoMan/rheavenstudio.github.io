# Setting up Heaven Studio

Heaven Studio is currently in a beta state, and we do not have any public releases as of right now. We currently have nightly builds that you can grab from our GitHub Actions, but support is not guaranteed. Please select your operating system accordingly:

- [Windows](https://nightly.link/megaminerjenny/HeavenStudio/workflows/windows/master/StandaloneWindows64-build.zip)
- [MacOS](https://nightly.link/megaminerjenny/HeavenStudio/workflows/macos/master/StandaloneOSX-build.zip)
- [Linux](https://nightly.link/megaminerjenny/HeavenStudio/workflows/linux/master/StandaloneLinux64-build.zip)

**Non-Windows users please note that the nightly builds have an issue with rendering some minigames (such as Karate Man) on non-Windows operating systems, please build the level editor by yourself by following this guide right [here](../docs-contributing/setup/introduction).**
